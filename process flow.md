# Getting Started
In this document I will cover how to use a Github project area (repoposatory) the 'Citizen way'. Knowledge of this proccess is important to everyone as it sets the common process and expectations that we all follow.

## The process flow
As a developer in a project area your tasks may very. Please modify the order of these flows to best suit your needs, while maintaing the core sprit of the flow.

## Assigning a task flow
This is generally the task of a Team Leader. If your project does not have one, you are free to assign your choose your own task. 

Assinging a task is a 3 step operation. 

- If the issue doesnt exist, follow the _creating a issue_ flow.
- Set the assingee to the person who is responsible to see the issue to completion.
- Assign the issue to the current project board into the "todo/backlog"
- Review the milestone and lables to make sure they are still relivant.

## Creating a issue flow
- Go to the issue tab and click create new issue in the upper right.
- Copy the issue template found here and review the purpose of the titles.
- If this is a draft issue, Note it at the top with draft, as you work on the issue.
- Fill in the template as needed.
- Ensure the body text is written in a tone that is engaging and clearly notes why we need this, what we are doing and why.
- Assign the correct labels for what features/catagories are being refrenced.
- Assign a size (EPIC, Sprint, Story, Task)
- The assignee can be you or left blank. Only team leaders, should assign tasks to other users. If you don't have one, then assign it to the person who will best follow/bring the issue to completion. If the issue requires a span of skill sets, this issue needs to be broken down.
- Assign youself untill you have broken down the issue into smaller component parts.

Issues should be singluar components/ideas. These may be big or small, but ultimilty singuar.AVVA
